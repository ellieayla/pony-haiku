These haiku were written between 2011â€“2020,
and published to reddit by the account /u/RespondWithPonyHaiku,
mostly as comments responding to other posts or commentary on artwork.

Most are written from the perspective of Derpy Hooves: mailmare, mother, friend, romantic dreamer, paperbag princess.

They are archived here for the perusal of wayward souls.

Many of the original threads reference deleted accounts and broken links. Walk softly.
